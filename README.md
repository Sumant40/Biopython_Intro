# Biopython Introduction

This repository contains an introductory Jupyter Notebook on **Biopython**, a powerful library for computational biology and bioinformatics. The notebook demonstrates fundamental operations such as sequence handling, analysis, and utilities that are widely used in genomics, proteomics, and molecular biology research.

## ðŸ“˜ Contents
- Introduction to Biopython
- Sequence objects and operations
- GC content calculation
- Sequence translation and transcription
- Reading/writing sequence files (FASTA/GenBank)
- Basic utilities from `Bio.SeqUtils`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Biopython
- Matplotlib

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/biopython_intro.git
cd biopython_intro
```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv bioenv
source bioenv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
bioenv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```
